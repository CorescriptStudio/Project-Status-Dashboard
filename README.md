# Project Status Dashboard

This project is a responsive Project Status Dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays project information in a structured layout and includes progress bars, status indicators, and a modern glassmorphism user interface.

# Description

The dashboard provides a clear way to track multiple projects by showing the project name, owner, current status, and progress percentage. Each row includes a dynamic progress bar that fills based on data attributes. The design uses a glass-style container with a background image overlay, neon highlights, and interactive hover animations.

This project is suitable for developers, teams, or individuals who want a clean and visually appealing way to present project tracking on a webpage.

# How It Works

Each project row contains a data-progress attribute that sets the progress bar width.

JavaScript reads the progress value and animates the bar.

The layout is designed as a grid on desktop and switches to stacked cards on mobile.

CSS handles all visual styling, including background image overlay, blur effects, and neon gradients.

# Usage

Open the project in any modern browser:

index.html
style.css
script.js


You can customize the project list, background image, colors, or animations by editing the HTML and CSS files.
